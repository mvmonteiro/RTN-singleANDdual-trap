# Random telegraph noise trap simulation

This repository has the aim of build a struct that can simulate a single and a dual trap behavior. 

## Context

The downscaling of channel area of transistor MOS leads to problems that impact in the clarity of the signal inside the circuits. So we can
increase the reability on this kind of system by some simulation tests with charge trapping.
